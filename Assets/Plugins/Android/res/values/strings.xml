	<!-- Set whether impressions use activities or not (default: true).
	       Use 'false' to disable. Any other value or no value at all will be read as true.
		 There are a number of implications of using this feature.
		 When true, Unity is paused while impressions are shown, but your game
		   will disappear while the impression animates in and out.
		 When false, pausing is managed in Unity code in the CBAndroidManager.doCustomPause() method.
		   We have provided a default implementation for you which you can feel free to modify.
		   Additionally, due to Unity optimizations, touch events will pass through Chartboost
		     impressions in Android 2.3+.
		   You will have to check if a Chartboost impression is open in any code that responds to
		     touch events.  You can use the CBAndroidBinding.isImpressionVisible() method for this purpose. -->
